# Introduction

Welcome to the HR Partner API documentation.  This site is designed for developers or advanced users of HR Partner to be able to create mini apps or routines to read (and sometimes write) information from our system.

We have created some short code snippets here using some popular languages in order to showcase how to use the API.

You must have an active trial or paid subscription to HR Partner in order to be able to use or test the API.  Sign up for an account now at [www.hrpartner.io](https://www.hrpartner.io)

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
# With Ruby, you need to pass the api key in the header with each request
require 'rest-client'

endpoint = 'https://api.hrpartner.io/employees'
header = {'x-api-key' => 'ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d'}

result = RestClient.get(endpoint, header)

puts result
```


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.hrpartner.io/employees"
  -H "x-api-key:ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"
```

```javascript
var Client = require('node-rest-client').Client;
 
var client = new Client();
var endpoint = "https://api.hrpartner.io/employees";
var info = {headers: {"x-api-key":"ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"}};

client.get(endpoint, info, function(data, response) {
  console.log(response;
});
```

> Make sure to replace `ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d` with your API key.

HR Partner requires a unique API key to ensure security of any calls to our API.  Every HR Partner company is issued a randomly generated API key that can be accessed by going to **Setup -> Configure -> Integrations** within the main menu (Note: You will have to have full access rights to HR Partner in order to access this menu).  You will also need to activate API access to your company, which is turned off by default for protection of your data.

Always keep your API key safe and secure like you would your password.  Anyone with your API key can access your company data, including all employee information and attachments etc.

If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, you can generate a new one within HR Partner, or else you can turn off API access to your company from the same menu area.

Your API key _must_ be included in all calls to our API gateway, in the header of each call as follows:

`x-api-key:ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>


# Endpoint

The HR Partner API supports a simplified REST protocol.  You may make GET, POST and DELETE calls against our REST endpoint at:

**https://api.hrpartner.io/**

All calls to the endpoint _must_ be made using the HTTPS secure protocol.  Calls made over HTTP will either be automatically re-routed to HTTPS or else be ignored.

# Disclaimer

Note: The API is still in Beta at this point in time, so the information below is subject to change with little notice.  Where possible, we will try not to make changes to our API interface which will break anything that was written using the older spec, but we reserve the right to make changes to improve performance or improve security without advanced notification during the Beta phase.


---

# Company

```ruby
require 'rest-client'

header = {'x-api-key' => 'ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d'}
endpoint = 'https://api.hrpartner.io/company'

result = RestClient.get(endpoint, header)

puts result
```

```shell
curl "https://api.hrpartner.io/company"
  -H "x-api-key:ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"
```

```javascript
var Client = require('node-rest-client').Client;
 
var client = new Client();
var info = {headers: {"x-api-key":"ee095c2f58da4f36d087ca7794384f4d"}};
var endpoint = "https://api.hrpartner.io/company";

client.get(endpoint, info, function(data, response) {
  console.log(response;
});
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Acme Industries",
  "slug": "adme-industries",
  "logo_image_link": "AyJfTPg769sI1wVSxQVwBQ/logo/acme_logo.png",
  "subdomain": "acme",
  "subscribed": true,
  "subscribed_until": "2099-03-21T00:00:00+00:00",
  "employee_limit": 50,
  "total_employees": 31,
  "active_employees": 26,
  "timezone": "Australia/Sydney",
  "sms_credits": 1.0
}
```

This endpoint retrieves your basic company data from HR Partner.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.hrpartner.io/company`

This call will return basic company information from HR Partner, including the company name, your subscription expiry information and employee counts.  It is useful for validating that you are communicating with the correct HR Partner company.

This endpoint retrieves a single employee from the system using their **_Employee Code_**.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.hrpartner.io/employee/{employeeCode}`

This call will return a lot more detail about an individual employee, including all their contact details, address details, as well as any custom fields that you may have created within your HR Partner company.


<aside class="notice">Tip: You can use the <code>GET /employees</code> call to get a list of all employees, then extract the <em>code</em> field from the results to fetch individual employees.</aside>

_<sup>*</sup> - Mandatory (required) field_

_<sup>+</sup> - If the field contains data that isn't already in HR Partner, it will be added to the list of drop down options_

Please note that the employee code is also required in the POST body as well as the URL for added verification and security.

#### Custom Data

The `custom_data` object within the employee data object will contain the field names and field contents of any custom fields that you have added to your HR Partner company.  Probably the best option is to execute a `GET` call on the `/employee/{employeeCode}` endpoint to get a current employee object and look at the structure of it to ascertain the exact structure of the object that needs to get sent back in the `POST` call.

<aside class="success">
  <strong>Note:</strong> You don't need to have ALL the custom fields in the <code>custom_data</code> object.  You only need to have the fields you want to update, and any fields not included will not be modified.
</aside>

#### Tags

The `tags` object contains an array of custom tags that you can allocate to the employee.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
tag | text | Tag name

Please note the construction of this object carefully.  It is not simply an array of strings, but rather an array of objects (see example of fetched employee data above).

If you use a tag that doesn't exist in HR Partner, that tag will get added to the list of tags, as well as being allocated to the employee.


#### Employee Contacts

This object contains the various contact items against the employee.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id | number | The internal ID number of the contact data. If included, the contact details will be **updated**. If omitted, the contact details will be **added**
type | text | Must be one of: _Phone, Email, Mobile, Fax, Pager, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Skype, Instagram, GitHub_
details<sup>*</sup> | text | The actual contact details (email address or number etc.)
is_primary | true/false | Flag for whether this address is primary (will be used as default address for system emails or SMSs) 


#### Employee Addresses

This object contains the various address data against the employee.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id | number | The internal ID number of the address. If included, the address details will be **updated**. If omitted, the address details will be **added**
type | text | Must be one of: _Home, Postal, Work, Delivery, Next of Kin, Visiting_
address_1 | text | First line of their address
address_2 | text | optional second line of their address
suburb | text | Either the suburb name or city name
state | text | The state or county name
post_code | text | Contains the zip or postal code

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> At this stage, you CANNOT delete a tag, contact or address record that is against an employee via the API.
